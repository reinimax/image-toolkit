Operations will be performed in order.

Dimensions like width or height can be given to the API in different ways: Generally, it will accept units of pixels and percent. If the unit is pixels, it can be omitted, since this is assumed as the standard.

There is only one API endpoint, which takes a lot of parameters. OpenAPI is great if you have a lot of small endpoints and methods, but that's not the case here. What I really needed was to document the single image manipulation operations. At the end, I decided to use pdoc, an easy to use library that generates pretty neat documentation and integrate it with mkdocs, linking this README file to the generated documentations index file using pymdown-extensions.</li> <li>In a similar vein, I looked into APIflask which has some neat features. But in the end I decided to stick with vanilla Flask and making some adoptions manually (e.g. making sure error responses are always sent as JSON instead of text/html). The reason is, I wanted to keep things simple and avoid the application being overloaded with features that I don't really use, especially since I decided against going with the OpenAPI approach.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<ul> <li>Huge thanks to HuggingChat for providing suggestions and feeback regarding some initial design decisions (link to the chat) and for help with debugging some stuff.</li> <li>This project would not have been possible without some amazing libraries.
