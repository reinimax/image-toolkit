Operations will be performed in order. If an invalid operation is given, or a valid operation fails, the other operations will still be performed.</li> </ul> <p>An <code>operation</code> object itself consists of a mandatory <code>name</code> field which specifies the operation that should be performed. The name is the same as the name of the processing function that will be called to do the work.</p> <p>Optionally, each operation accepts arguments that specify how the image should be processed, e.g. a width and/or height for resizing an image. Dimensions like width or height can be given to the API in different ways: Generally, it will accept units of pixels and percent. If the unit is pixels, it can be omitted, since this is assumed as the standard. These would all be valid arguments:</p> <pre><code>\"width\": \"300px\"\n\"width\": \"300\" // 300px, as above\n\"width\": 300\n\"width\": 300.0 // this works too, but is considered bad practice\n\"width\": \"50%\" // 50 percent\n</code></pre> <p>Optionally, within the key <code>return_as</code>, you can also provide a format in which the image should be returned, along with some options for image quality. Refer to the Supported formats page for more details. If <code>return_as</code> is ommitted or contains an invalid format, the image will be returned in the same format in which it was submitted.</p> <p>A complete payload might look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"operations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"rotate\",\n            \"degrees\": 180\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"resize\",\n            \"width\": \"50%\",\n        },\n        // ... any other operations you like to perform.\n    ],\n    // optional return format and options\n    \"return_as\": {\n        \"format\": \"webp\",\n        \"quality\": 80\n    },\n    \"original_image\": \"...\" // base64-encoded image\n}\n</code></pre>","text":""},{"location":"#api-response","title":"API response","text":"<p>A successful response from the API will look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"metadata\": {\n        \"format\": \"jpeg\", // format of the processed image\n        // width and height of the processed image\n        \"height\": 374,\n        \"width\": 300\n    },\n    \"processed_image\": \"...\" // base64-encoded image\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If you get back the original image, or some operations were not performed, this probably means you provided invalid/incomplete parameters to some operation(s). If you found a bug, feel free to open an issue.</p> <p>If you really messed up the <code>JSON</code> payload or did not provide a correctly encoded image, you will get an error response instead:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"error\": \"No image provided.\" // The error message will try to explain what caused the error.\n}\n</code></pre> <p>However, I tried to design this API pretty robust and forgiving, so (hopefully) what you'll see more often is just some operation not being performed if you forgot an argument or mistyped something.</p> <p>You can look up the available processing functions and the arguments they expect in the API documentation (ignore the <code>image</code> argument, as this will be passed in automatically).</p>"},{"location":"#accepted-file-formats","title":"Accepted file formats","text":"<p>The supported formats page lists the formats that the API is guaranteed to accept and return.

This is more user-friendly, because it lets you chain operations together in one single request.</li> <li>I tried out autogenerating API documentation using flaskapi and the OpenAPI spec, which is awesome in principle, but didn't convince me in the context of this project. There is only one API endpoint, which takes a lot of parameters. OpenAPI is great if you have a lot of small endpoints and methods, but that's not the case here. What I really needed was to document the single image manipulation operations. At the end, I decided to use pdoc, an easy to use library that generates pretty neat documentation and integrate it with mkdocs, linking this README file to the generated documentations index file using pymdown-extensions.</li> <li>In a similar vein, I looked into APIflask which has some neat features. But in the end I decided to stick with vanilla Flask and making some adoptions manually (e.g. making sure error responses are always sent as JSON instead of text/html). The reason is, I wanted to keep things simple and avoid the application being overloaded with features that I don't really use, especially since I decided against going with the OpenAPI approach.</li> <li>For implementing different formats in which the image can be returned, I decided to follow an approach very similar to the one for operations: Create a new file that defines saving functions and dynamically call them if a valid image format was submitted. I tried first a simpler approach with dynamically passing arguments to the <code>save</code> function of the <code>Image</code> class. This is less code, but I decided against it for 2 reasons:  First, defining custom save functions allows for better auto-generated documentation.  And second, perhaps more important, it allows for providing default arguments that are different from the ones provided by Pillow, and for additional validation. The chosen approach is more verbose, but I find it also more robust and explicit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<ul> <li>Huge thanks to HuggingChat for providing suggestions and feeback regarding some initial design decisions (link to the chat) and for help with debugging some stuff.</li> <li>This project would not have been possible without some amazing libraries.
